# What is overclocking

CPU is just like human, when your CPU is being manufactured in the factory, they all have different peak performance. For example, a set of CPUs can run maximum at 4.70Ghz, 4.65Ghz, 4.55Ghz, 4.60Ghz. To make sure most of the chips pass the stress test, manufactures set the maximum clock to where average CPUs and reach.

I am currently using a Ryzen 5 5600, its default clock is set to 4.45Ghz, with PBO, it can reach 4.65GHz easily. But that is often not the limit of CPUs, so in this blog, I am going to teach you how to overclock your CPU without much harm.

:::caution
Overclocking your CPU can cause damage to your CPU if voltage and clock are set too high. Remeber, Ryzen AM4 Chips are most comfortable at or below 1.35V, anything above could fry your CPU

# Silicon Lottery

Buying a CPU is just like buying a lottery, but it's a little bit different. This lottery guarantee you a base clock that you can run at. But that CPU you've got might also be a jackpot. Able to reach a much higher clock than most others can. If you are able to squeez out more performance for the same amount of money, it's free performance gain.

## Different kind of overclocking on Ryzen Chips

| Name | Performance Gain | Pros | Cons | Clock |
|------|------------------|------|------|-------|
| Default | None | Minimal thermal, the most stable clock | Lowest performance | Fixed |
| PBO | Around 5-10% | Adjust clock based on temperature, higher single core performance | Clock fluctuate frequently | Fluctuate |
| OC | Around 15-20% | All core reach peak performance all time | No thermal throttling, higher power usage | Fixed |

### Which one fits you best?

If you just want to use Office, have some browsing and minesweeper. Default base clock is perfect for you, no extra noise, performance totally enough.

If you often play games that doesnt require too much CPU performance, eg. 3A games. And your daily workload involves several apps opened, the PBO is much better. It cools down when not using, and can boost to a safe clock during sudden workloads.

If you play competitive games like CS2, Valorant, or CPU-heavy task like rendering a Blender scene or file compressing. It is the best to OC your CPU.

:::Important
Before OC, make sure your cooler is good enough for the thermal that your CPU is going to set off. A 65 Watt CPU can easily reach 130-150 Watt after overclock. If you currently do not have a cooler that can sustain long period of heat from CPU, PBO is better. As OC DOES NOT have Thermal throttling, you PC would just force restart after CPU junction temperature reach roughly around 95-100°C

# PBO/OC spec requirement

Unlike Intel, AMD is very generious on the limit of overclocking. You only need a B-Series or X-Series board to overclock. But beaware, the limit of different motherboard may vary. The lowest quality B550 might not even provide 100 Watt of power but a top teir B550 could easily provide 250 Watt or above.

| 500 Series | 400 Series | 300 Series | Overclockable? |
|------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| X570 | X470 | X370 | Yes |
| B550 | B450 | B350 | Yes |
| A520 | None | A320 | No |

## How do I check my motherboard model?

For Windows Users, press Win+R, type cmd and enter. Then paste the following

```bash
msinfo32
```

A system information windows should open up. There housld be a section called Motherboard product. Here my motherboard shows up as ROG STRIX X570-I GAMING

Now you might be wondering, why do I have a -I at the end of X570, that is because I am using a [ITX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-ITX) motherboard, designed especially for small PC case. If you have something like X570S, B550M. It doesn't matter, as long as you have the name included in the list that support overclocking, you are good.

## CPU Stepping

CPU stepping is important, it kind of gives you expectation you can get out of your CPU. To check your stepping, download CPU-Z from [here](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html).

Here, you can see my stepping is 2, which means B2. Remeber this value to use later on. Also take a note of your CPU Model, here for example, is Ryzen 5 5600. If your stepping is B0, then I would recommend using PBO, since early stage CPU are known to be hard to overclock, and very unstable.

## Updating motherboard

It is very important that we have the latest BIOS installed in our motherboard. It is well known for AMD Motherboard to update their BIOS frequently, especially if you bought the motherboard on release. Then there should be a lot more feature added on later.

To update your BIOS, search your motherboard model in Google.

![](/assets/images/5600oc/mbwebsite.webp)

Open the site and click on support. On Asus website, you should see a Driver&Tools section, which contains BIOS&Firmware. Remeber NOT to downlod the beta firmware, they can get unstable and brick your PC.

Next, watch a few tutorial on how do update your motherboard BIOS, since the method is very different for different motherboard. From ASUS EZ FLASH, which is dummy proof, to other motherboard where you do not have a GUI for flashing BIOS.

# PBO/OC Time~

Fully shutdown your PC. Turn it on and quickly press the key that matches your motherboard BIOS key.

For me, both **DEL** and **F2** works. A good method is just to place your entire arm on the keyboard, pressing F1-F12 at the same time as DEL.

If you see something like this. Well done! You are half way there!

![](/assets/images/5600oc/27.webp)

Now, many BIOS provide a easy mode for some simple change. But we want to hit F7 here to enter advanced mode. If you are seeing something like below without entering Advanced mode, then you can ignore this procedure.

![](/assets/images/5600oc/extreme.webp)

Now, we want to head to "Extreme Tweakers" section. Use your arrow key to navigate between pages.

If you just want to enable PBO, enter the "Precision Boost Overdrive" section. Change the "Precision Boost Overdrive" From Auto to Enable, or Manual for even better performance. Set the "Procision Boost Overdrive Scalar" to 10, and "CPU Boost Clock Override" to 200.

![](/assets/images/5600oc/pbo.webp)

If you are doing OC, then open "Digi+ VRM/Digi+ Power Control, leave CPU Loadline Calibration to Auto, and tweak the rest to maximum if possible. We leave CPU Loadline Calibration becuase CPU Voltage will drop during heavy task. If the voltage drops too much, the CPU might "starve" and restart. So we need to determine wether we need to adjust the Loadline later on during testing.

![](/assets/images/5600oc/38.webp)

Now, we need to some repetitive. Find the best voltage and frequency for your need. I would first set the CPU Voltage to around 1.3V, because from 1.3V onwards, the wattage increase is very significant. To do this, change the CPU COre Voltage from Auto to Manual. And type in 1.3.

:::caution
Double, Triple check your voltage after typing, with modern motherboard, some limit the value in a range, which might be fine, but for others, it could be catastrophic. 0.13V will need a BIOS Reset to boot again, and 13V without protection from motherboard would cook both your CPU and your Motherboard. MUST MUST CHECK!

## What should I set for CPU Core ratio?

The value for same type of CPU could vary by a lot. It depends on the stepping of your CPU, and the data manufactured. For example, a Ryzen 5 5600 is nearly impossible to reach 4.6Ghz on B0 stepping, but easy to reach 4.7Ghz or above on B2 stepping. First of all, we need to check the boost clock of our CPU. Search up your CPU model on [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/).

![](/assets/images/5600oc/techpowerup.webp)

You can see here, it said boost clock is 4.4Ghz, which vary for different CPU. If you are on B0 stepping, I would recomment give 4.5Ghz a try, and if you are B2 stepping, go straight for 4.7Ghz. So the trick here is to **+0.1Ghz for B0, and + 0.3Ghz for B2**.

Then, we can go up and find the "CPU Core Ratio" section. Because the BLCK frequency is **100** (On default), you will only see this value on X-Series motherboard, but for the B-Series board, the **BLCK frequency is also 100.** Therefore, to reach a CPU value of for example, **4.75Ghz**, we will need to type in **47.5**.

Press F10 to save and exit, if your PC still boots up, congratulations, that is the first stage done!

:::caution
DO NOT modify the BLCK frequency unless you understadn what it does. Lower value can cause instability, high value can destroy SSD controller and your GPU.
:::

# Testing and more tweaking

Even if you boot into the system, it is very posible that your CPU is still not stable enough for work and gaming. First, download [cinebench](https://cinebench.net/) and [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/). Open AIDA64 and select check monitor. 

![](/assets/images/5600oc/hwinfo.webp)

You would want to keep a close eye on SVI2 TFN and CPU overall temperature. Now hit the cinebench with Multi-core stress test. It is normal for system to shutdown anytime in between, if temperature gets higher than 90°C, stop cinebench.

If your system pass the 10min stress test, you are 90% safe. Just open up some CPU heavy task that you would normally do (eg. Gaming, Blender rendering). And give it a test.

:::note
It is normal for AMD CPUs to not pass ADIA64 FPU tests after overclock, but it doesn't affect the overall stability.
:::

Now, there are much more we can do, so here is the optimising part.

# Optimisation/Problem fixing

If you want to have CPU run with a even high clock, you can slowly increase the CPU Frequency up by **25Mhz** every time, don't touch the voltage, untill the point where system crash on Cinebench or daily task. 

If you are encountering terperature issue on PBO, don't worry, that is very normal for PBO, as the CPU Clock boost is based on the temperature. 

But if you are doing OC and temperature is high, you can consider reducing voltage, as its direct affect of temperature. Keep the clock the same, and lower the voltage by 0.05 every time. Repeat stress test until crash, and add 0.05 V back.

Now, there is one type of crash that is different. If you are stress testing your system, temperature are all normal, but the system still crashed. You would first observe if the CPU Voltage dropped by too much during heavy task (eg. from 1.35V to 1.32V). If that is the case, go back to BIOS and change the CPU Loadline calibration as mentioned before. I would suggest start from Level 2 to have a try. Increasing by 1 level everytime you crash and find a balance point. If it still doesnt help, you can try reducing the clock by **25Mhz** each time.

# Conclution

The goal here is to find the highest clock the CPU can run at, and slowly decrease the voltage, so you get the most performance out of a CPU without having the CPU idle at 100 Watt.

I will be uploading more about overclocking for both RAM, GPU and maybe monitor as well (Yes! You can overclock your monitor)
