# What does MobileGestalt do?

MobileGestalt is a core framwork of Apple devices, is bascially a **digital ID** that provide essential information about the device. By editing MobildGestable, we can trick the device into thinking its something else. 

For example, you can enable features like Apple Intelligence, dynamic island on iPhones that doesn't have them. Or, you can trick your iPhone into thinking its an iPad, and thus enabling stage control and the new macOS like "desktop mode" on your iPhone.

If you want to tweak your iPhone and unlock features that Apple refuses to give you, this is the guide that you should follow.

# Preparing

:::caution
There is a slight possibility of bricking your iPhone during this process, I've done this process for over 20 times without a problem, but it doesn't mean this won't happen to you. Always keep a backup of your iPhone before you continue with the process.

You will need, 
1. Cable
2. PC (Windows, Mac)
3. Device that you want to modify (iPad, iPhone)
4. Brain (optional)

To modify the MobileGestalt file, we firstly need to extract the file from the Phone.

1. Download [this](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/23246/) shortcut onto your iPhone.
2. Run the shortcut, there should be a tutorial
3. Save the file to somewhere you know
