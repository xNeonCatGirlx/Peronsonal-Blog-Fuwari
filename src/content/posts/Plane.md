# Why is it possible to track planes

Like other Mode S communications, ADS-B makes use of the 1090 megahertz transponder to transmit data. The protocol for ADS-B is open, and low-cost receivers can easily be used to intercept its signals. ADS-B is a feature of many planes to self trasmit its data, we can make sure of it by having a antenna and a USB dongle to decode the data. By using dump1090 and tar1090, we can visually "see" where the plane we are tracking are on the map.
